# ElixirCodingGames

Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data.
If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero
(for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.
